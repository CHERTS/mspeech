Functional description for the correction of text transferred into the fields of other programs.
================================================================================================

Functional correction is to use several methods for processing the detected final
line of text.

Step 1: AutoCorrect
When you send the text in the program is a replacement of certain words from the list on the punctuation:
For example, a text: hi comma how are you question mark
Replace list of words on the signs:
point -> <.>
comma -> <,>
dash -> <->
exclamation mark -> <!>
question mark -> <?>
Bottom line: hi, how are you?

Step 2: Make the first letter of sentence
When you send the text in the program is replaced by the rules of the register:
Which follows after the character <.> <!> <?> Letter is translated to uppercase.
For example, the text of the Step 1: hi, how are you?
Transforms into: Hi, how are you?

After Step 2 is submitted in the entry field of the program.
